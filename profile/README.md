# RDS AI 

Welcome to **RDS AI**'s GitHub! We are an innovative AI research and development organization focused on pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence through cutting-edge reflective cognition systems and advanced AI frameworks.

## Our Mission 

At **RDS AI**, we aim to redefine the future of artificial intelligence by developing systems that go beyond traditional machine learning models. Our core focus is on creating AI that can **think reflectively**, utilizing advanced memory architectures and contextual understanding to enable more human-like interactions.

### Current Projects

### 1. **Reflective Dialogue System (RDS)** 
**RDS** is our flagship AI framework that enables **self-reflective learning** through memory-based AI models. RDS allows AI systems to store, retrieve, and apply past experiences in real-time conversations, leading to deeper, more intelligent interactions.

- **Key Features**:
  - Reflective learning from previous interactions.
  - Emotion and context tagging for enhanced memory retrieval.
  - Short-term and long-term memory systems for context-aware responses.
  - Customizable AI outputs based on memory and past knowledge.
